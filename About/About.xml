B18 UPDATED

Version: 1.7
	
Description-
This mod adds several new dog species to the game. All dogs are considered pets so they can randomly be chosen to drop with pawns. [strike]All dogs are currently also found in the wild, mostly forests. Currently - Corgis, Jack Russell Terriers, Beagles, Dalmatians, Pitbulls, Sheepdogs, Dachshunds, Boxers and Pugs.[/strike]

Note - 
Pitbulls and Jack Russells have a slightly higher chance to attack on failed taming. 
Sheepdogs are shearable and produce &apos;Sheepdog Wool&apos; 

For those of you using ADS, I&apos;ve made it compatible with the ADS easy patcher. Mod Load order should be -
ADS, ADS Easy Patcher, Whaleys Dogs. 

As far as I know this mod shouldn&apos;t cause any problems with any other mods, and it should work with existing saves.
